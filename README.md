# Sports Elimination

The Baseball Elimination problem is an application of the Maximum Flow Problem.
In `Baseball.java`, I provide a solution to the problem as specified by `Princeton's Coursera Specification:` https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/baseball/specification.php

## Problem Description:
- There are n teams competing in a league. At each point during the season, each team has some number of wins, losses, and remaining games to play.

## Goal:
- To determine mathematically which teams have a chance of finishing the season in first place (with ties allowed).
